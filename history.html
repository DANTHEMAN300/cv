			<p class="img_pad">IBM was incorporated in the state of New York in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company or C-T-R for short. It was the consolidation of three smaller companies: Hollerith's Tabulating Machine Company, Computing Scale Company of America, and the International Time Recording Company (Chronological History of IBM, n.d.). C-T-R sold business machines. In the early 20th century, this term referred to specialized tools such as calculators and typewriters. Computers as we know them today, general-purpose machines that can perform the tasks of both of these machines and more, did not yet exist, and would not develop a market of any note until the mid-century (Hemmendinger & Freiberger, 2019).</p>
	<p>In 1914, C-T-R brought on 40-year old <a href="watson_sr.html">Thomas J. Watson, Sr.</a> as a general manager. His time in the position was transient, as within the year he was promoted to president of the company. Watson re-focused C-T-R from selling a diverse range of business machines to only large-scale, custom ones.  In 1924, in light of C-T-R&apos;s expansion into Europe, the company was renamed International Business Machines or IBM for short (Chronological History of IBM, n.d.).</p>
	<p>During the Great Depression in the 1930s, IBM was one of the few businesses that not only managed to stay afloat amidst the economic turmoil but grow. In 1935, with the advent of the Social Security Act, IBM, under a U.S. government contract, put their machines to use maintaining employment records for 26 million Americans (Chronological History of IBM, n.d.). In the 1940s, IBM continued working with the U.S. government to develop machines to assist in World War II. Among these machines were several electromechanical calculators, which were the precursors to electronic computers. Building these machines for the government granted IBM valuable expertise in electronic technology and placed it in an ideal position to enter into the burgeoning computer market. Nevertheless, Watson Sr. was hesitant  to take the company into this new and largely untested market. It was not until his son, <a href="watson_jr.html">Thomas J. Watson, Jr.</a>, became president of the company in 1952 that IBM finally took the plunge and developed its first commercially available electronic computer <a href="ibm_701.html">IBM 701</a> that same year (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020a).</p>
<p>A large and established company by this point, IBM was able to quickly take control of the computer market through a combination of heavy investment into computer development, marketing expertise, and pre-existing dominance in business machines (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020a). The computers IBM initially sold were mainframe computers, medium-to-large data processing machines that only big organizations could afford. However, by the late 1970s personal computers had taken off, offering for the first time a type of computer that the average person could reasonably afford. Again, IBM did not jump headfirst into this emerging market. By the early 1980s however, an IBM lab director named <a href="lowe.html">William C. Lowe</a> was able to convince the company's executive to enter the market, which it proceeded to do with incredible speed, debuting the <a href="ibm_pc.html">IBM PC</a> in 1981 (Campbell-Kelly, Aspray, & Ensmenger, 2013).
</p>
<p class="bottom_pad">IBM was unable to achieve dominance in the PC market. The company, this time hindered by its immense size rather than aided by it, was not as adept at reacting to the dynamism of the market as smaller companies were. In 2005, IBM sold its personal computer division to major Chinese manufacturer Lenovo Group and began shifting away from the manufacture of so-called commodity products to concentrate on other ventures  (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020a). Since the beginning of the 21st century, some things of note IBM has done include building supercomputers for governments and large corporations, designing computer chips for gaming systems such as the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and developing a computer called <a href="watson.html">Watson</a> that competed in <em>Jeopardy!</em> and beat two of the TV quiz show&apos;s biggest champions (A Computer Called Watson, n.d.).
