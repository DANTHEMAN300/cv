			<p class="img_pad">The subject of this website is the International Business Machines Corporation, better known as IBM, which is a leading American computer company headquartered in Armonk, New York. I chose to research IBM because I became intrigued by the company after learning about it in the class I am taking this semester centered on the history of information technology in the United States. Prior to this class I, like many others, only knew vaguely of IBM, but I have since come to learn of the influential role the company has played in IT not just in America but worldwide.

<p>On this website you will find information pertaining to the history of IBM and some of its important people and products. This website is in no way intended to cover these topics exhaustively. IBM has existed for over one hundred years, and in that time there have emerged numerous texts that discuss the company in far greater detail than you will find here. This website is simply an overview of IBM that will hopefully encourage you to seek out more in-depth resources about the company if you are interested.</p>
