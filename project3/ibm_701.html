			<p class="img_pad">The IBM 701 was IBM&apos;s first commercially available scientific computer. In a meeting with his company&apos;s stockholders, President <a href="watson_jr.html">Thomas J. Watson, Jr.</a> referred to the machine as &quot;the most advanced, most flexible high-speed computer in the world&quot;. Known as the Defense Calculator while in development, it was initially built to assist the U.S. government in the Korean War in the early 1950s. IBM secured 18 orders for the machine from various U.S. aircraft and defense firms (IBM 701, n.d.).</p> 
<p class="bottom_pad">Development of the computer, from design to assembly, took place in record time, spanning less than two years from early 1951 to late 1952. The first model was installed at IBM&apos;s headquarters in New York. The machine was a large-scale electronic computer and IBM&apos;s first stored-program computer, meaning that its programs were stored internally on electronic memory. Furthermore, it was capable of performing 16,000 addition or subtraction operations a second and printing nearly 200 letters or numbers a second, and while still quite large by today&apos;s standards, it took up significantly less space than IBM&apos;s previous computers. The IBM 701 marked the beginning of IBM&apos;s transition into the electronic computer market (IBM 701, n.d.).</p>
