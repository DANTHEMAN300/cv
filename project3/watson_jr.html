		<p class="img_pad">Thomas John Watson, Jr. was the son of <a href="watson_sr.html">Thomas J. Watson, Sr.</a> and his successor at IBM. Watson Jr. was born in Dayton, Ohio in 1914. After obtaining a B.A. degree from Brown University in 1937, he began working at IBM as a salesman. In 1952 he was elected president of IBM after his father stepped down, and four years later, a month before his father died, he became CEO of the company, and then chairman in 1961 (Thomas J Watson, Jr., n.d.).</p>
<p class="bottom_pad">The passing of the baton between Watsons marked a major change in IBM. Under Watson Sr., IBM had been a successful albeit medium-sized company that sold products such as mechanical tabulators and typewriters. Under Watson, Jr., the company transitioned into selling computers and quickly became a world leader in that market. By the time Watson Jr. stepped down as chairman and CEO in 1971, IBM&apos;s staff had increased from 72,500 worldwide to over 270,000, and its net income had increased from $87 million to $1.079 billion. <em>Fortune</em> Magazine dubbed Watson Jr. the &quot;most successful capitalist who ever lived&quot;. On December 31, 1993, Watson Jr. died in Greenwich, New York due to complications with a stroke. He was 79 (Thomas J. Watson, Jr., n.d.).</p>
