			<p class="img_pad">William Cleland Lowe was an American businessman who oversaw the development of one of IBM&apos;s landmark products the <a href="ibm_pc.html">IBM PC</a>. Lowe was born in Easton, Pennsylvania on January 15, 1941. In 1962, he obtained a physics degree from Lafayette College and became a product test engineer at IBM. Eventually, he rose to the position of director of the company&apos;s research labs in Boca Raton, Florida (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020c).</p>
<p>In 1980, Lowe proposed to IBM&apos;s top executives that he could assemble a team and build a personal computer for the company in a year. This was a big claim. IBM, although a titan in corporate and government mainframe computing, had intentionally stayed out of the growing PC market for years in large part because its production system was too slow. All hardware and software components of IBM products were made in-house. However, Lowe recognized the outdatedness of this system and instead made innovative use of open architecture to develop the IBM PC. This production system shaved significant time off of the development of a product by outsourcing various components to other suppliers. Due to this, Lowe was able to follow through and finish the IBM PC a year after he first proposed it (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020c).</p>
<p class="bottom_pad">Lowe left IBM in 1988 and subsequently took executive positions at a number of other companies including Xerox, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, New England Business Solutions, and the Moore Corporation. On October 19, 2013, in Lake Forest, Illinois, he died of a heart attack at age 72 (Yardley, 2013).</p>
