	<p class="img_pad">Watson, named after <a href="watson_sr.html">Thomas J. Watson, Sr.</a>,  is a computer developed by IBM&apos;s research division IBM Research. Unlike search engines, which when you ask a question, return thousands of search results that may relate to your query, Watson is designed to analyze a question and respond with a specific answer. Watson can hold the equivalent of one million books worth of information and over the years has been fed information from a variety of sources including encyclopedias. When asked a question, Watson executes hundreds of algorithms that determine hundreds of different answers, ranks those answers in terms of plausibility, and then returns the highest-scored answer, all in the span of about three seconds (A Computer Called Watson, n.d.).</p>
<p class="bottom_pad">In 2011, Watson was put on the TV quiz show <em>Jeopardy!</em> where it defeated champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter over the course of three matches taped at the IBM Research laboratory in Yorktown Heights, New York. It did not trounce Jennings and Rutter, having flubbed some obvious questions. At one point its response to a question under the U.S. cities categories was &quot;What is Toronto?&quot;. Nevertheless, the computer performed well enough to take the lead during the second match and carve out a victory in the third and final match. At the time of Watson&apos;s victory, IBM already had big plans for the machine beyond trivia. One of its plans was to collaborate with Columbia University and the University of Maryland to create a cybernetic assistant that physicians can use to ask questions (Markoff, 2011).</p>
