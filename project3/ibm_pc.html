			<p class="img_pad">Completed in 1981, the IBM PC was IBM&apos;s version of the personal computer. Personal computers had been available since the mid-1970s. However, the two main factors that prevented IBM from initially entering into the market were one, a lack of applications for the machines that made them viable for business purposes, and two, the pervading idea that IBM was too large to turn out a personal computer fast enough to match the dynamism of the market. However, in the 1980s, things began to change. Software such as word processors and spreadsheets had by then been developed for PCs, making them viable business machines. Furthermore, <a href="lowe.html">William C. Lowe</a>, the lab director in the company's Boca Raton, Florida facilities, was able to convince IBM&apos;s top executives that he could produce a personal computer for the company within the year (The birth of the IBM PC, n.d.). This tight deadline was met by outsourcing most of the components that went into the computer, including the operating system software, which IBM bought from Microsoft, then a small, thirty-eight-person operation in downtown Seattle  (Hemmendinger & Freiberger, 2019). The IBM PC was announced at a press conference in New York City on August 12, 1981. It  included a system unit, a keyboard, a color/graphics capability, and a suite of business applications. Additionally, it was priced at only $1,565, a significant reduction from IBM&apos;s mainframe computers of decades prior, which cost millions of dollars and processed information far less quickly (The birth of the IBM PC, n.d.).</p>
<p class="bottom_pad">IBM distributed the PC through ComputerLand; Sears, Roebuck and Co.; and IBM Product Centers to make it available to the broadest set of customers possible. The product was a massive success, selling at a rate of a system-a-minute every business day by the end of 1982. <em>Newsweek</em> magazine dubbed the IBM PC &quot;IBM's roaring success&quot; (The birth of the IBM PC, n.d.).</p>
