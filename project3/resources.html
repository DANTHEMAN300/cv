	<h3 class="extra">Additional Information</h3>
	<p>The banner at the top of each webpage with the words &quot;IBM: An Overview&quot; is the graphic created from scratch. I made it myself using Adobe Photoshop. On the site, I used images, video, and audio as my embedded media. Images can be found on every page except resources.html. Video can be found on history.html and watson.html. Audio can be found on watson_sr.html. Every image on the site uses a CSS rollover effect. When you hover your mouse over any image, it will unveil information about it. Additionally, the navigation bar uses a CSS rollover effect. When you hover over &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Products&quot; a dropdown menu appears that was constructed purely out of CSS. I did not use any JavaScript for this project.</p>
<p>Three factors of the site that I feel are really well done and should be considered A-level work are the images, design, and navigation. As I have said before, every image on this site incorporates a rollover effect. On Project 2, I placed information about my images below them in captions. However, in this project, the information is unveiled by hovering your mouse over the image, which I believe is far more aesthetically pleasing. The design follows the CRAP principles well, especially Contrast. I believe the colors I used on the site generate a good contrast with one another. Additionally, the colors I used are the IBM official colors of blue, black, and white, which I think is a nice touch. I got the hex code for these colors from a webpage, listed in the above references, called &quot;IBM Colors&quot;. Lastly, as I said before, the navigation incorporates a dropdown effect when you hover over &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Products&quot;. I think it goes above and beyond the scope of the project because we did not learn how to do this in class and I spent a lot of time making this work through experimentation with CSS rollover effects.</p>
<p class="bottom_pad">Two factors of the site that I feel could use improvement are the graphic and the behavior. While I am proud of my graphic, I do admit that it is simple, and that that simplicity is born out of the fact that I am only just beginning to learn how to use Adobe Photoshop and am by no means extremely skilled with it. Similarly with JavaScript, I was not comfortable enough with the language to incorporate it into my website, which is why I instead stuck to purely HTML and CSS. As a result, my website's behavior is not as advanced as it could have been had I incorporated JavaScript.</p>
