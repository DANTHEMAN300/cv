			<p class="img_pad">Thomas John Watson, Sr. was an American industrialist known for greatly expanding IBM over the course of his several decades working at the company. The son of a lumber dealer, Watson Sr. was born on February 17, 1874 in Campbell, New York. As a young man, he attended the Elmira School of Commerce before beginning work as a salesman and eventually landing a job at the National Cash Register Company in Dayton, Ohio. Watson Sr. arose to the position of general sales manager at the company before leaving it in 1914 to work at IBM, then known as C-T-R, where he became president (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020b).</p>
<p>At the time, C-T-R had a smattering of offices across the United States and Canada. It sold a diverse range of products, from tabulators and punch cards to meat and cheese slicers, and was finding its diversified business difficult to manage. Watson Sr. re-focused the company into providing large-scale, custom-built tabulating machines for businesses and leaving the market for smaller products to others (Chronological History of IBM, n.d.). He utilized his experience in his previous profession to bolster company morale and cultivate the utmost loyalty and motivation in its staff. To this end, he organized pep talks, family outings, and employee sports teams, and implemented his now famous slogan &quot;Think&quot; (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020b).</p>
<p class="bottom_pad">Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Watson Sr. aggressively pursued international trade and extended IBM&apos;s monopoly on business machines to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia (Chronological History of IBM, n.d.). In 1952, Watson Sr. handed over the IBM presidency to his son, <a href="watson_jr.html">Thomas J. Watson, Jr.</a>, and became chairman of the company. Four years later he died in New York City, New York on June 19, 1956. By then, IBM's workforce had grown from 234 in 1914 to 60,000, and the company had 200 offices throughout the country and factories and assembly plants around the world (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020b).</p>
